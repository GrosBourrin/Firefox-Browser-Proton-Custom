# Firefox-Browser-Proton-Custom
  A custom userChrome.css for Firefox 86+ ([Beta](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/#product-desktop-beta), [Developer](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/#product-desktop-developer) and [Nightly](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/#product-desktop-nightly) for February 2021).
  **For personal purpose only.**

## Features?

**Firefox-Browser-Proton-Custom** is a more "cleaner" version of my custom [Firefox-Browser-UI-Custom](https://github.com/gabeweb/Firefox-Browser-UI-Custom/)
and aditionally has some extra things like:

- Revert to some Firefox standard items, but keeping the customized url-bar, **widgtets panel** and useful ***go-arrow*** button.

But first you must verify that you have these parameters activated via *about:config*:

- `browser.proton.enabled` and `browser.proton.tabs.enabled` must be ***true***

This *userChrome.css* file use code snippets collected from other sources, so the credits (mostly) are for their authors:

## Bugs?

Yes, the themes are forks of other projects, so there are many bugs in the code, for example the context menus do not properly reflect the shadows in all environments, nor does the background color of the side panel context menus change (Firefox Browser Nightly 78 "breaks" some things).

I'm not a programmer, but at least I tried to make a new theme for al Firefox users ü§òüèª


**Suggestions and ideas are very, very welcome!**


*PS: screenshots soon. Tested on Windows 10 and elementary OS.*
